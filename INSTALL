# Install get_fasta_info and get_fastq_info

A C-compiler and the make system is needed to build the
programs from source. If required tools are in place, run:

    ./configure
    make

And to install (standard location usually `/usr/local/bin/`):

    sudo make install

To install in, e.g., user's own `~/bin/` directory, use

    ./configure --prefix ~ ; make ; make install

See `./configure --help` for options.
