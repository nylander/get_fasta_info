# Install get_fasta_info and get_fastq_info

A C-compiler and the make system is needed to build the
programs from source. Furthermore, the compression library zlib
also needs to be installed. On a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system,
this can be accomplished by

    $ sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev

If required tools are in place, run:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

And to install (standard location usually `/usr/local/bin/`):

    $ sudo make install

To install in, e.g., user's own `~/bin/` directory, use

    $ ./configure --prefix ~ ; make ; make install

See `./configure --help` for options.
