# Install get_fasta_info and get_fastq_info

A C-compiler and the make system is needed to build the
programs from source. Furthermore, the compression library zlib
also needs to be installed. On a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system,
this can be accomplished by

    $ sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev

If required tools are in place, run:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

And to install (standard location usually `/usr/local/`):

    $ sudo make install

To install in, e.g., user's own `$HOME` (binaries in `$HOME/bin`), use

    $ ./configure --prefix $HOME ; make ; make install

See `./configure --help` for options.


Troubleshooting:

When cloning from Github you may run in to this problem when running make:
```
get_fasta_info/missing: line 81: aclocal-1.16: command not found
WARNING: 'aclocal-1.16' is missing on your system.
```
Try to run `touch aclocal.m4 configure config.h.in Makefile.* src/Makefile.*`
*before* running `./configure`, and try again. Alt. re-clone, touch, and configure.

Alt. 2. Install `automake` (`sudo apt install automake`), re-clone and configure.
